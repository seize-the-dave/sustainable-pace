Background
--

This post describes a collaborative exercise for mapping a value stream.  The goal of mapping the value stream is to highlight areas of waste within a value-adding process, thereby enabling the reduction (or elimination) of those wastful activities.

Ideally, this exercise will include everyone who plays a role in the value stream, although it can be done with delegates if everyone can be faithfully represented.

Materials
--

You will need:

- Blank whiteboard
- Sticky notes, ideally in three different colours
- Pens (enough for each participant)

Preparation
--

The facilitator prepares the whiteboard by drawing a lightbulb (:bulb:) at one end, and a currency symbol (:dollar:) at the other.  These mark the beginning (concept) and end (cash) of the value stream.  The facilitator then takes three sticky notes (ideally different colours) and labels them as appropriate:

- Value-Adding
- Type I Waste (Necessary)
- Type II Waste (Unnecessary)

If sticky notes of three different colours are not available, use a simple symbol to mark each in the corner, such as a currency symbol (:dollar:) for value-adding, a confused smiley (:confused:) for necessary waste and a frowning smiley (:frowning:) for unnecessary waste.  The symbols you choose should be quick and easy for people to draw.

Arrange piles of sticky notes in a place which is easy for everyone to access, and provide enough pens for each participant to have one each.  Facilitators need to make sure there are no barriers for contributing to the value stream map.

Exercise
--

Once the collaboration space has been prepared, participants should be introduced to the board any sticky notes, and invited to walk through the process being mapped from beginning to end.  It's quite common for steps to be broken down once they've been written down, so make sure participants leave plenty of space between steps.
