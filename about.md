Over the past {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: '2000' }} years, Dave has worked in a number of different roles in the software industry including time spent as a Developer, Development Lead, Scrum Master and Product Owner.  This breadth of experience has helped Dave to gain a deep understanding of how software is delivered.

Dave now coaches organisations on how to improve the ways in which they deliver software, with a focus on Agile and Lean/Kanban techniques.  Dave first encountered Agile ways of working around 2006 after reading a whitepaper about Scrum adoption at Yahoo! and has sought to increase his knowledge and experience ever since.  He has provided Agile coaching to the following organisations:

- UCAS
- Monitise
- DevOpsGuys
- Sorenson Media
- Specific Media

In his spare time, Dave helps to organise the South Wales Agile Group, and has delivered a variety of talks and workshops at a number of well-known European conferences.  Dave is a member of the Scrum Alliance, Agile Alliance, and the BCS.
