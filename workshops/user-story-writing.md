## What's Involved?

In this one-day workshop, we'll teach you how to use user stories effectively with your development team.

### Terminology

The terminology around user stories can be confusing. Consider these questions:

- When does an epic become a user story?
- Is an epic the same as a theme?
- What are acceptance criteria?
- How do I deal with non-functional requirements?

By the end of the workshop, you'll have a clear understanding of common terms we use when talking about user stories, and how they relate to each other.

### User Story Principles

We'll teach you how to create great user stories to help bridge the gap between what your customer wants from your product, and what the development team needs to build it.  We'll also explain why good stories should be kept as small as possible, and why adding detail to stories can sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes.

### Splitting Stories

We'll share foolproof techniques for splitting user stories into smaller chunks, whilst ensuring that they still deliver value to your customer.
